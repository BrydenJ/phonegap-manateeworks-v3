# PhoneGap implementation (see below for ionic and ionic2)


Guide on how to add the Manatee Works Barcode Scanner SDK PhoneGap plugin to your project(s)

**For more info, visit our website at [www.manateeworks.com/phonegap-plugin](https://manateeworks.com/phonegap-plugin)**

##Install using CLI interface (Phonegap >6.0 and above).          

*First make sure you have the latest software required to run phoneGap apps. This means nodejs and git should be on your system.*
*For more information about that, visit: [phonegap's getting started.](http://docs.phonegap.com/getting-started/1-install-phonegap/cli/) *

Install PhoneGap:

```ssh
$ sudo npm install -g phonegap@latest
```

Create your app by using CLI interface:
 
```ssh
phonegap create my-mw-app 
```

or use bundle identifiers, we bind our license with the bundle identifier!

```ssh
phonegap create my-mw-app --id "org.mwscanner.sampleapp" --name "mwbScanner"
```
	
Previous step will create a folder named *my-mw-app*, navigate to your newly created folder and add the platforms you want to build with:
	
```ssh
cd my-mw-app
phonegap build android 	//if you are developing an android app
phonegap build ios    //if you are developing an ios app
```
Add our plugin to the project with:

```ssh
phonegap plugin add manateeworks-barcodescanner-v3
```

or   

```ssh
phonegap plugin add https://github.com/manateeworks/phonegap-manateeworks-v3.git
```
or   

```ssh
phonegap plugin add LOCAL_PATH_TO_THE_FOLDER_WITH_PLUGIN (if you are adding from local folder)   
```
 
 **Important**  
The MW_LICENSE_KEY variable can be added later in an xml file respectively for each platform

 - For iOS you can add a row in your *.plist file, with the following format MW_LICENSE_KEY : THE_KEY_FROM_MWDN
![ios-plist](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5564013/23270653/da3fda0c-f9f4-11e6-9944-fd3bb246ce59.png)
 - For Android you can use the AndroidManifest.xml file and the meta-data element named MW_LICENSE_KEY and place your key as value instead of KEY_FROM_MWDN
![android-manifest](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5564013/23270678/e9836010-f9f4-11e6-9e4e-c780b7af6d94.png)
 - For Windows (UWP) you can use the Resources.resw file and the element named MW_LICENSE_KEY, where you can set your license in place of YOUR_LICENSE_KEY in the value section
![windows_resw](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5564013/23270749/33a2168c-f9f5-11e6-947a-25041ecf5376.png)

We also provide setting the key via a JavaScript call.
    
Perform initial build for each platform.   

```ssh
phonegap build ios
phonegap build android
phonegap build windows
```

### Setting up your app

  Add a button to index.html which will handle the call to the scanning function

```html
<button onClick="mwbScanner.startScanning();" style="width:80%;margin:15%;height:180px">scan</button>
```

The scanner is initialized with default settings.   You can change these settings with the **loadSettings()** method.


For phoneGap apps we include a **MWBConfig.js** where this can be handled. Obviously for your use case you don't need to use this file, and you can provide your own, and you probably will handle it differently, but for the needs of this document let's include it in our **index.html**. It needs to be included with a script tag like:
    
```html
  <script type="text/javascript" src="cordova.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="js/index.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="js/MWBConfig.js"></script><---add it here!! ->
  <script type="text/javascript">
      app.initialize();
  </script>
```
 
Here you can do a few things:    
If you skipped adding your license key when installing (and on windows platform), you can set your key with **setKey()**
    
```javaScript
  return mwbScanner.setKey('input-your-key-here').then(function(response){
        //response of the setKey action
  });
```
    
   This method returns a promise that resolves to a boolean value which is true if the key was valid, and false in all other cases (invalid appname, invalid key etc).
    
  Configure your scanner with the desired settings - you should use **loadSettings()**.   
  
  **Expects an array of key/value objects** used to set preferences for the scanner. The **key** is the name of the **method** and the **value** is the **parameters** (passed as an array) expected by that method.   

```javascript
var cc =  mwbScanner.getConstants(),settings;
   settings = [{'method': 'MWBsetActiveCodes', 'value' : [cc.MWB_CODE_MASK_25 | cc.MWB_CODE_MASK_39 | cc.MWB_CODE_MASK_93 | cc.MWB_CODE_MASK_128 | cc.MWB_CODE_MASK_AZTEC | cc.MWB_CODE_MASK_DM | cc.MWB_CODE_MASK_EANUPC | cc.MWB_CODE_MASK_PDF | cc.MWB_CODE_MASK_QR | cc.MWB_CODE_MASK_CODABAR | cc.MWB_CODE_MASK_11 | cc.MWB_CODE_MASK_MSI | cc.MWB_CODE_MASK_RSS | cc.MWB_CODE_MASK_MAXICODE | cc.MWB_CODE_MASK_POSTAL]}];
```
Load your settings with
```javascript
return mwbScanner.loadSettings(settings).catch(function(reason){
			console.log(reason)
		});
```

#### How to scan an image

Instead of mwbScanner.startScanning() use:

```javascript
mwbScanner.scanImage(URI);
```
        
or with custom init and callback:

```javascript
mwbScanner.scanImage(URI,function(result){
	//custom callback 
});
```
        
Params:   
```javascript        
URI                     - the path to the image
callback                - custom callback function
```        
        
#### How to scan in partial screen view

Instead of mwbScanner.startScanning() use:

```javascript
mwbScanner.startScanning(x, y, width, height);
```
        
        
or with a custom init and callback:

```javascript    
mwbScanner.startScanning(function(result){
//custom callback
}, x, y, width, height);
```        
        
Params:   
        
```
x, y, width, height     - rectangle of the view in percentages relative to the screen size
callback  - result callback

```

Example:   

     Scan fullscreen  -  scanner.startScanning()
     Scan in view     -  scanner.startScanning(0,4,100,50)
     Pause/Resume     -  scanner.togglePauseResume()
     Close            -  scanner.closeScanner()
     Flash            -  scanner.toggleFlash()
     Zoom             -  scanner.toggleZoom()

##Windows (UWP) specifics

###Requirements

 - Visual Studio with Universal Windows App Development Tools
 - MWBarcodeLibUniversal SDK W10 extension
(You can download it from https://manateeworks.com/files/download_latest/mobiScan-Windows, and then install 10.0\MWBCameraDemo\MWBarcodeLibUniversalSDK.vsix)

###Post-build settings (required)
 - In the solution explorer, set the project **CordovaApp.Windows10 (Universal Windows)** as startup project.
 - In this project’s directory, open the file **package.windows10.appxmanifest** and in the capabilities tab check **Webcam** from the list.
 - On some devices, there might be a problem with deployment and starting the scanner which can be fixed by
removing the following line from the **index.html** file.
```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src * 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; media-src *" />
```

###Adding a license

The license is not set during plugin add, instead, you can set it in **Resources.resw**, which is an xml file. 
This file is part of the WindowsComponnent project and is located in Strings\en-US. Once the solution is built, you can open it via Visual Studio. It contains one element named **MW_LICENSE_KEY**, where you can set your license in place of **YOUR_LICENSE_KEY** in the value section. This license won't be taken into account during registration if you set a key string in **MWBScanner.js** (which is not advised).

###Functionalities

 - The function **scanImage()** requires image files to be placed in the www folder.
 - The usage of front camera is currently not available.

###Performance
The camera capture and preview are implemented in JavaScript on the web side. Windows doesn't seem to support non-native implementation well, and this results in lower frame rate than hardware available. This can be improved by using a lower camera resolution (480p instead of the default 720p), which can be set with the method **MWBenableHiRes** and **false** as value. Some devices with slower processors could further improve their frame rate by reducing the number of cores the decoder uses (default is all), by using the method **MWBsetMaxThreads** with a value **lower than all CPU cores but not lower than 1**.

# IONIC 1 Implementation


Manateeworks barcode scanner can be loaded as an ionic plugin, which uses cordova, so every phonegap plugin could run as an ionic plugin with little to none change. Most of the changes are in the configuration files, due to how the projects are organized in ionic (or even ionic2)

Just like phoneGap, 

First we ensure we have nodejs installed and latest ionic and cordova see (http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/) for more:

```ssh
npm install -g cordova ionic
//depending on your OS, this could very well be:
sudo npm install -g cordova ionic
```   
if it's already installed, updating is done with:
```ssh
npm update -g cordova ionic
```
or
```ssh
sudo npm update -g cordova ionic
```

Then we create an ionic app (similar to the phonegap process, where we *created* an app, here we *start* one). 
Currently ionic is using v2, and ionic v1 may be completely retired, but for the purpose of clarity we provide these steps to getting an ionic v1 app running.

```ssh
ionic start -a "Manateeworks Barcode Scanner Ionic App" mwbScanner blank -i com.ionic.manateeworks --v1
cd mwbScanner
ionic plugin add manateeworks-barcodescanner-v3 --variable MW_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY
```

<center>or</center>

```ssh
ionic plugin add https://github.com/manateeworks/phonegap-manateeworks-v3.git --variable MW_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY        
```

<center>or</center>

```ssh
ionic plugin add LOCAL_PATH_TO_THE_FOLDER_WITH_PLUGIN --variable MW_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY (if you are adding from local folder)  
```

In the platforms www folder (url is an example if you are developing for ios)  
    
```ssh
$PATH_TO_FOLDER/mMwApp/platforms/ios/platforms/ios/www/examples/ionic
```
there are example files named exactly like the files you need to change to get the app started. 
*app.js* should be replaced with the one in *js/app.js* and *index.html* should be replaced with the *index.html* of your app.

Demo app NOW available [HERE!](https://github.com/manateeworks/manateeworks-barcodescanner-starter)
    
# Ionic 2

Step 1 is the same as ionic, so:

```ssh
ionic start myMwApp blank --v2
cd myMwApp
ionic plugin add manateeworks-barcodescanner-v3 --variable MW_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY
```
which will create an ionic 2 blank app. This will create a slightly different project structure than phonegap or ionic 1.

App development in ionic2 is a little different, due to the fact that angularJS2 is used, so project structure is quite different than regular phonegap, or even ionic 1.

If you are building for ionic 2 this is not news to you so we will presume that you are familiarized with the structure of your app.
To build for ionic 2 you need to modify the files in your **src** folder. Ionic 2 pushes typescript usage, so whatever you code needs to be compiled to be used as normal javaScript. 

You should have:

```ssh
/src/pages/home folder 
```

We want to modify the **home.html** file, and add a button and a text input (which will show the result) and the home.ts file which will handle the control of the scanner. These files have been copied in the examples folder when you added our plugin. 
Copy the files to your ```ssh /src/pages/home folder```.

Important thing to notice is the addition of the 

```javascript
declare var mwbScanner:any; 
```

this is done, to stop ionic2 from complaining about mwbScanner missing. 
The mwbScanner variable becomes available after the cordova plugins load, so in order to "import" it to our component controller, we define it as a variable that can receive any value.

Since manateeworks-barcodescanner plugin is essentially a phonegap plugin, naturally we use a callback to show results. But we also return a promise, which is more an ionic2 way. To disable the default callback we need to do:

```javascript
mwbScanner.setCallback(function(result){});
```
Then to show results from a scan we simply do

```javascript
mwbScanner.startScanning().then(function(response){
	console.log('show the result here');
	console.log(response);
	//actual example in home.ts is different
});
```

Build for your platform
```ssh
ionic build ios
```
    
And run your app.
